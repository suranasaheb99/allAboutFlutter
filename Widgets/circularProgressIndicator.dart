//A material design circular progress indicator, which spins to indicate that the application is busy.
//A widget that shows progress along a circle. There are two kinds of circular progress indicators:
//Determinate. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time,
//     and the value should increase monotonically from 0.0 to 1.0,
//     at which time the indicator is complete. 
//     To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between 0.0 and 1.0.
//Indeterminate. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains.
//To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.
//The indicator arc is displayed with valueColor, an animated value. 
//To specify a constant color use: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(color).
